        <p>As of May 2023, CO2 PPM (parts per million) is at 420.00 and the global temperature rise is 1.15C compared to pre-industrial levels. This is undoubtedly one of the biggest environmental problems of our lifetime: as greenhouse gas emissions blanket the Earth, they trap the sun’s heat, leading to global warming.

            The last time carbon dioxide levels on our planet were as high as today was more than 4 million years ago. Increased emissions of greenhouse gases have led to a rapid and steady increase in global temperatures, which in turn is causing catastrophic events all over the world – from Australia and the US experiencing some of the most devastating bushfire seasons ever recorded, locusts swarming across parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia, decimating crops, and a heatwave in Antarctica that saw temperatures rise above 20C for the first time. Scientists are constantly warning that the planet has crossed a series of tipping points that could have catastrophic consequences, such as advancing permafrost melt in Arctic regions, the Greenland ice sheet melting at an unprecedented rate, accelerating sixth mass extinction, and increasing deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, just to name a few.</p>

        <h2>Sustainable Lifestyle Recommendations</h2>
        <p>1.Get Educated<li>Understanding the latest news on the most pressing environmental issues is a great place to start. Find out how your actions and habits feed into the problems we face, then see where your elected officials stand on the issues. Armed with this knowledge, you can make informed decisions about who to support and how to take action to create a more sustainable world.</li></p>
        <p>2. Limit Waste <li>Reducing the waste we generate, especially non-biodegradable waste, is one of the most important things we can do for the environment. So many of the things we throw away end up in landfills or get dumped into the ocean, where they pollute the water and pose a threat to sea life</li>
        </p>
        <p>3. Limit Atmospheric Emissions<li>Being mindful of what's released into the atmosphere is just as important as reducing what's discarded on earth. That's why taking steps to limit carbon emissions is another cornerstone of sustainable living.

            Airplanes are one of the most significant emissions sources; even short trips have a massive impact on the environment. Limiting flights and choosing to travel by land (or sea) can reduce your carbon footprint and save money, too. But when that’s not possible, choose the most direct route, ideally a nonstop flight. For land travel, take public transportation where it’s available, carpool with friends or co-workers, walk or cycle.</li>
        </p>
        <p>4. Conserve Water and Energy<li>Many easy-to-implement lifestyle changes will conserve water and energy.

            Turn the water off while washing your hands and brushing your teeth, take shorter showers, and only run the washing machine and dishwasher when they’re full. Replace standard faucets and showerheads with low-flow models. If your toilets, washing machine or dishwasher are older, chances are they consume a lot of water. If you can afford it, springing for newer models that are more efficient will help cut down on both the water and power you use — and save you money, too.</li></p>
        <p>5. Advocate for Change<li>We’re all responsible for our own choices, but promoting sustainability in your personal and professional networks can make a real difference. Pushing your workplace to adopt more eco-friendly policies, getting involved in sustainable programs at your child’s school or campaigning for ballot initiatives that protect the environment are ways to build community and create a better world.</li></p>
